    <p class="home">The increase of usage of smartphones paved the way to creating responsive and mobile web designs.  According to an article in BGR website, the number of users who use mobile for browsing surpasses the number of users of desktop [1].  Hence, when developing and designing websites, one of the key considerations is to ensure that this works for different platforms.  In addition to, the are also new products such as tablets that can be used for browsing.  For this reason, it is important to consider the responsiveness of the website.
	Mobile websites are specifically designed for mobile users, while responsive websites works for cross-platforms.  One of the advantages of making the website responsive is it caters to a large number of users.  Although, from the developerâ€™s perspective, coding a responsive website is more tedious, the outcome is more user-friendly.</p>
    <p>	It is also important to note that for Search Engine Optimization (SEO), responsive websites are easier to find by the search engines because mobile sites have different URLs on their desktop counterparts [2].  However, one of the downside of having responsive website is its complexity for developing which follows that responsive websites are more expensive to build.  There is also a challenge on integrating responsive sites with interfaces that run on the backend.</p>
	<p>Having said all this, responsive websites outweigh the effectiveness of mobile sites.  However, there are factors to be considered in choosing between the two.  As a developer and designer who is dedicated at giving the client the best experience, it is strongly recommended to use a responsive website.  Moreso, as a business person, it is better at improving the customer base through SEO.</p>
