 <h2 class="pageID">Shopping Carts for eCommerce</h2>
    <p class="home">Electronic commerce (e-Commerce) has grown rapidly.  This has improved the customer's experience for quicker and accessible way to purchase products and services.  For this reason, it has affected how business is being done digitally.  It also is the primary reason why introducing shopping carts in business websites are presently in demand.</p>
    <p>
A shopping cart is an important component of online business.  This way, a customer may be able to select and request products or services without physically being present in the store.  PayPal being a means to pay for goods online, has also dedicated a page on how to integrate payment buttons and other cart features that are useful for developing a shopping cart.</p>
<p>Shopping carts are continued to being developed as there are frequent concerns whether the right cart provides safety, if it enables a variety of payments, and if it offers other functional capabilities [1].</p>
	<p>Functional codes are being openly published by Paypal on their Developerâ€™s Page - from using buttons to carts.
