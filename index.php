    <p class="home">Hi!  My name is Flora May.  I am currently in taking a career-gap to reinvent my career and focus on family and friends, travel, and learn something new.  I am doing a short-term certificate program at Seattle Central College - taking Web Development and Design classes.  I plan to create an online portfolio that I could use for applying to a graduate program focusing in Human Computer Interaction and Design.

    <p class="home">Eight years ago I earned my bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering at Ateneo de Davao University.  A year after, I worked as an IT Specialist at IBM Philippines.  I fixed the errors of the client's operating system running in IBM i.  It was fun and exciting.  However, since I always wanted change and challenge myself.  I eventually moved from a technical role to a business role.  I mananged the business unit's operations.

    <p class="home">Fast forward to today, I want to know more about UX design to open the door in moving to product management.  There are plenty of uncertainties on this entire process and lifestyle.  But I strongly believe that with hardwork and dedication, things are possible.
